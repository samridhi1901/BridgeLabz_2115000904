Day 1 - 19/01/25

Learned to print messages in Java.
Implemented user input for basic arithmetic operations.
Developed a program to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using user input.
Calculated the area of a circle based on user input.
Computed the volume of a cylinder with user-provided values.

Day 2 - 22/01/25

Practiced basic programming concepts.
Explored user input handling in Java.
Implemented programs for calculating the area of a triangle and unit conversions (e.g., kilometers to miles).

Day 3 - 23/01/25

Studied conditional statements and solved related problems.
Explored looping structures (while, do-while, and for loops) and solved various problems.
Worked on operator-based problems, including logical operators in loops and conditional statements.
Solved problems using nested loops and nested if-else conditions.
Learned about switch-case and implemented a program using it.

Day 4 - 25/01/25

Gained an understanding of arrays and their different data types.
Explored array properties and built-in methods while solving related problems.
Learned about 2D arrays and applied them to problem-solving.

Day 5 - 28/01/25

Studied methods in Java.
Explored user-defined and built-in methods.
Utilized built-in methods such as Math.pow(), Math.random(), and Math.sqrt().
Implemented recursion and applied it in various problems.
Developed complex programs, including matrix operations.

Day 6 - 29/01/25

Learned about strings and practiced string manipulation.
Explored built-in string functions such as length(), charAt(), and indexOf().
Solved string-related problems using both built-in functions and manual implementations.

Day 7 - 31/01/25

Introduced to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Solved OOP-based problems.
Explored practical applications of OOP in software development.

Day 8 - 02/02/25

Understood the difference between class variables and instance variables.
Solved problems related to class and instance variables.
Learned about inheritance and the extends keyword, followed by problem-solving exercises.
Worked with classes and subclasses while implementing inheritance.

Day 9 - 04/02/25
Today, I worked on multiple Java programs to strengthen my understanding of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as static variables, final variables, the this keyword, and instanceof checks through real-world applications. Below is a summary of the programs I implemented:

Student Management System

Utilized OOP principles, including static variables for common attributes, final variables for unique student IDs, and instanceof checks to validate object types.
Vehicle Registration System

Designed a system incorporating static methods, final registration numbers, and instanceof checks before displaying vehicle details.
Hospital Management System

Managed patient data using static variables for hospital names, final variables for unique patient IDs, and instanceof checks for object validation before displaying information.
General OOP Reinforcement

Practiced core concepts such as static methods, final variables, the this keyword, and instanceof checks by implementing real-world applications.
